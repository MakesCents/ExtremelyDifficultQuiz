<p>This is a quiz which is supposedly extremely difficult. Probably won't be though. It's intended to push the boundaries of your imagination. Or was it to imagine the pushing of your boundaries? Anyways it's built with Java swing things, and it's to feature some animations, sound, 8-bit shenanigans, and quirkiness. Because if there's no quirkiness there really is no point.</p>

<p>This is made by these people: 
<code>&lt;/br&gt;</code></p>

<p>It's in white font and/or it's really small font, I swear. Keep looking.</p>
